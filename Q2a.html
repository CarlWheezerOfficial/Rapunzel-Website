        <h3>You chose to go shopping!</h3>

        <p>
            You choose to go shopping in the city.
            <br>
            There are many amazing shops that peak your interest.
            <br>
            Flynn gently takes your hand,
            <br>
            
            "I know a really good shop with some dresses and jewelry." He says,
            <br>
            "You might want to put on something nice before we go see the lights."
            <br>

            You tell him that sounds good. You've never been in a shop before, so you're excited to go.
            <br>

            The two of you enter the shop. You buy this really pretty purple dress with lace on the front.
            <br>
            You also buy some simple jewelry, two bracelets and a necklace.
            <br>

            "You look really nice!" Flynn says, smiling.
            <br>

            You thank him, smiling. You haven't worn nice clothing like this before.
            <br>
            You think about how you wish mother would have bought you something like this.
            <br>

            "Alright, you ready to move on?" Flynn asks.
