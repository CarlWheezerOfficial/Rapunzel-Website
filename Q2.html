        <h3>You ask the man to take you to see the lights!</h3>

        <p>
            He rolls his eyes, "Why shold I take you? Traveling costs money, y'know." 
            <br>

            "Don't worry about that." You hold up a special beret you always wear.
            <br>

            "Are those real emeralds?!" He asks, surprised.
            <br>

            "Yup! It's yours if you take me to see the lights" You smile, knowing you trapped him.
            <br>

            "Fine, fine. I'll take you." He says, letting his greed get the better of him.
            <br>

            Before you leave, you ask the man something important.
            <br>
            "Hey, what's your name?" You ask.
            <br>
            "Flynn Rider, what's yours?" He asks.
            <br>
            "Rapunzel" You respond, starting to walk alongside him.
            <br>


            You walk for a long time through the forest, until you approach a beautiful kingdom.
            <br>
            A large castle is the first thing you see, followed by the city, followed by the bridge leading too it.

            
        </p>
        <br>

        <p>"What's the first thing you wanna do? We have some time to kill before we see the lights." Flynn says.</p>
