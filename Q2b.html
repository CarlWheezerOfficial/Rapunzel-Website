        <h3>You go the the caf√©!</h3>

        <p>
            Flynn takes you to a cute little coffee shop. The two of you sit at a table.
            <br>
            "What would you like?" He asks.
            <br>

            You tell him you've never had coffee before.
            <br>

            Flynn smiles, "I think I know something you'll like."
            <br>

            A waitress comes over, and Flynn orders for the two of you...
            <br>

            While you wait for the food you decide to make small talk with Flynn.
            <br>

            Out of curiosity, you ask Flynn why he was in the forest when you met.
            <br>

            "Well, I was... doing business." He said, obviously lying.
            <br>

            You pester on, wanting the truth.
            <br>

            "Well..." He pauses, "I'm actually a thief... I'm the person on the wanted posters too."
            <br>
            
            He chuckles, "They can never get my nose right."
            <br>

            He looks ashamed of himself. 
            <br>

            You tell him he can choose for you.
            <br>

            Flynn chats with you more until the food comes.
            <br>

            You're inlove with the food he chose.
            <br>
            You two eat tea sandwiches, muffins, cookies, and more.
            <br>
            You also immediately fall inlove with the coffee he got for you. It was vanilla flavored.
            <br>
            You two leave, both full and happy.
