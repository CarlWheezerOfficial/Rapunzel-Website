        <h3>You go the the caf√©!</h3>

        <p>
            Flynn takes you to a cute little coffee shop. The two of you sit at a table.
            "What would you like?" He asks.
            <br>

            "Uhm... I don't know, I've actually never had coffee."
            <br>

            Flynn smiles, "I think I know something you'll like."
            <br>

            A waitress comes over, and Flynn orders for the two of you...
            <br>

            While you wait for the food you decide to make small talk with Flynn.
            <br>

            "So, why were you in the forest when you found me?" You ask, curiously.
            <br>

            "Well, I was... doing business." He said, obviously lying.
            <br>

            "Are you sure?" You pester.
            <br>

            "Well uhm..." He pauses, "I'm actually a thief... I'm the person on the waned posters too."
            <br>

            He look ashamed of himself. 
            <br>

            "Well, you still helped me. I'm happy we met, Flynn." You say, sincerely.
            <br>

            A smiles, and chats with you more until the food comes.
            <br>

            You're absolutely inlove with the food he chose.
            <br>
            You two at tea sandwiches, muffins, cookies, and more.
            <br>
            You also immediately fall inlove with the coffee he got for you. It was vanilla flavored.
            <br>
            You two leave, both incredibly full and happy.
