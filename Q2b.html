        <h3>You go the the caf√©!</h3>

        <p>
            Flynn takes you to a cute little coffee shop. The two of you sit at a table.
            <br>
            "What would you like?" He asks.
            <br>

            "Uhm... I don't know, I've actually never had coffee."
            <br>

            Flynn smiles, "I think I know something you'll like."
            <br>

            A waitress comes over, and Flynn orders for the two of you...
            <br>

            While you wait for the food you decide to make small talk with Flynn.
            <br>

            You ask him what he was doing in the forest.
            <br>

            "Well, I was... doing business." He says, obviously lying.
            <br>

            "Are you sure?" You pester.
            <br>

            "Well uhm..." He pauses, "I'm actually a thief... I'm the person in the wanted posters too."
            <br>

            He look ashamed of himself. 
            <br>

            You tell him that it's alright, and that you're happy you met him.
            <br>

            Flynn smiles, and chats with you more until the food comes.
            <br>

            You're absolutely inlove with the food he chose.
            <br>
            You two eat tea sandwiches, muffins, cookies, and more.
            <br>
            You also immediately fall in love with the coffee he got for you. It was vanilla flavored.
            <br>
            You two leave, both full and happy.
