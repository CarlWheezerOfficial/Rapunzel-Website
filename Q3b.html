        <h3>You stand side-by-side with Flynn, ready for anything.</h3>

        <p>
            You and Flynn face the thugs together.
            <br>
            "Rapunzel, catch!" Flynn throws you a frying pan.
            <br>
            You wonder where he got the pan from, but you push the thought aside.
            <br>
            You slam the first thug in the head with the pan.
            <br>
            Pow!
            <br>
            Flynn taks out the other thug.
            <br>
            "Are you okay?" He asks.
            <br>
            You nod, wiping your eyes.
            <br>
            Alright, shall we? Flynn motions.


        </p>
        <br>

        <p>Go with Flynn!</p>
