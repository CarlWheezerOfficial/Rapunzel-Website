        <h3>You reject Flynn.</h3>

        <p>
            Flynn has a saddened look on his face.
            <br>
            "It's alright, I understand." He says.
            <br>
            The rest of the boat ride is a bit awkward, but Flynn still escorts you back to the tower.
            <br>
            Once you're home, Flynn apologizes one more time.
            <br>
            "Thank you, for everything." He says as he disappears into the forest.
            <br>
            "I finally saw the lights, at last... Even if I didn't find my happily-ever-after, I'm still happy."
            <br>
            
        </p>
