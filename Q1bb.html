        <h3>You chose to clean!</h3>

        <p> 
            You put your long, golden hair up the best you can.

            You mop, sweep, clean the counters, do your laudry.
            You paint the walls some more, hoping there's room somewhere.

            Several hours pass...

        <p>Pick something else to do!</p>
