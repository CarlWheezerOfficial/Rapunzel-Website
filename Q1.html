        <h3>Beginning your story!</h3>
        
        <p>It is a gorgeous Summer morning and you wake up in your tower. 
            You stare outside at the majestic sunrise and take a deep breath. 
            As you wake up you realise that your mother isn't home.
            Tonight is the night that the lanterns will fill the sky. 
            You've always dreamed to see them but your mother has always told you no... </p>
            <br>
            <p>You can make a choice. Do you leave your tower to go see the lights against your mother's will...
                 Or do you stay and miss out on them?</p>
