           <h3>Beginning your story!</h3>
        <p>
            It is a gorgeous Summer morning and you wake up in your tower.
            <br> 
            You stare outside at the majestic sunrise and take a deep breath. 
            <br>
            As you wake up you realise that your mother isn't home.
            <br>
            Tonight is the night that the lanterns will fill the sky. 
            <br>
            You've always dreamed to see them but your mother has always told you no... 
        </p>
            <br>
        
            <p>You can make a choice. Do you leave your tower to go see the lights against your mother's will...
                <br>
                 Or do you stay and miss out on them?</p>
