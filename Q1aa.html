        <h3>You chose to wander around!</h3>

        <p> 
            You wander around for awhile, seeing wanted posters posted around.
            The posters have a young man in leather clothing on them. They all read "Wanted". 
            You wander for awhile, losing your way. You look back behind you and realise you're lost!

            After awhile more of wandering, you sit down under a tree, compltelty stumped.
            A young man approaches you, looking similiar to the man in the wanted posters.
            His nose looks compltely different than the man in the wanted posters', however.

            "Hello miss! Have you seen any royal soldiers around here recently?" The man says, seeming... anxious?
            You tell him the truth, that you haven't seen any. He lets out a sigh of relief.
        </p>

        <p>This man is quite curious. Pick something to ask him!</p>
