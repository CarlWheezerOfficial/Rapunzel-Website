        <h3>You chose to wander around!</h3>

        <p> 
            You wander around for awhile, seeing wanted posters posted around.
            <br>
            The posters have a young man in leather clothing on them. They all read "Wanted". 
            <br>
            You wander for awhile, losing your way. You look back behind you and realise you're lost!
            <br>

            After awhile more of wandering, you sit down under a tree, compltelty stumped.
            <br>
            A young man approaches you, looking similiar to the man in the wanted posters.
            <br>
            His nose looks compltely different than the man in the wanted posters', however.
            <br>

            "Hello miss! Have you seen any royal soldiers around here recently?" The man says, seeming... anxious?
            <br>
            You tell him the truth, that you haven't seen any. He lets out a sigh of relief.
        </p>
        <br>

        <p>This man is quite curious. Pick something to ask him!</p>
