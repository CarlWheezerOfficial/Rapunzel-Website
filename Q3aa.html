        <h3>You try to stop them yourself.</h3>

        <p>
            You jump infront of Flynn, and quickly grab the thug's arm.
            <br>
            He swings around his arm, and shoves you off of him.
            <br>
            Before you can recover, he runs towards you...
            <br>
            Blood seeps into your pretty clothing.
            <br>
            Flynn runs over to you, tears in his eyes. His face gets less recognizable as your vision blurrs.
            <br>
            You can hear the muddled sounds of Flynn's cries, as well as the panicked screams the thugs.
            <br>
            "I guess happily-ever-afters are just fairytales."
