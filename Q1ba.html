        <h3>You chose to cook!</h3>

        <p> 
            You get flour and sugar from the pantry.
            <br>
            You grab some butter, eggs, spices, and apples.
            <br>

            A few hours fly by and you've made an apple pie!
            <br>
            The smell of cinnamon wofts through the tower.
