            <h3>You chose to leave the tower!</h3>

            <p>
                You use your long, golden hair to guide yourself down the mossy walls of the tower.
                <br>
                The outside is beautiful;
                <br>
                the gras tickles your feet, the sun glazes your eyes, and the chirping of the birds blesses your ears.
                <br>
                The outside is paradise, just as you imagined. 
            </p>
            <br>

            <p>You now have the choice to wander around or stay by your tower. 
            <br>
            The outside not only intrigues you, but it also scares you a bit.</p>
