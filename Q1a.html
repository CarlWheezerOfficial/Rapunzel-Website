        <h3>You chose to leave the tower!</h3>

        <p>You use your long, golden hair to guide yourself down the mossy walls of the tower.
            The outside is beautiful; the gras tickles your feet, the sun glazes your eyes, and the chirping of the birds blesses your ears.
            The outside is paradise, just as you imagined. 
        </p>
        <br>

        <p>You now have the choice to wander around or stay by your tower. The outside not only intrigues you, but it also scares you a bit.</p>
