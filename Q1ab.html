        <h3>You chose to stay near the tower!</h3>

        <p> 
            You sit around for awhile, enojoying the summer air and the sun.
            After some time, you hear rustling coming from the forest nearby.
            As you approach the noise, a young man suddenly appears from the bushes!

            He seems like he's in some sort of hurry. 
            "Hello miss! Have you seen any royal soldiers around here recently?"
            You tell him the truth, that you haven't seen any. He lets out a sigh of relief.
        </p>
