        <h3>You chose to stay near the tower!</h3>

        <p> 
            You sit around for awhile, enojoying the summer air and the sun.
            <br>
            After some time, you hear rustling coming from the forest nearby.
            <br>
            As you approach the noise, a young man suddenly appears from the bushes!
            <br>

            He seems like he's in some sort of hurry. 
            <br>
            "Hello miss! Have you seen any royal soldiers around here recently?"
            <br>
            You tell him the truth, that you haven't seen any. He lets out a sigh of relief.
        </p>
        <br>

        <p>This man seems quite curious. Ask him a question!</p>
