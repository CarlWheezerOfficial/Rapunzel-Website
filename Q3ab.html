        <h3>You jump back, leaving Flynn to fend for himself.</h3>

        <p>
            Flynn grabs the thug's hands, begging for his life.
            <br>
            The thug overpowers Flynn, stabbing him in the stomach.
            <br>
            His body falls to the ground. Blood staining his clothing.
            <br>
            He looks back at you, with a smile, as the light fades from his eyes.
            <br>
            You over over his body.
            <br>
            "I'm sorry." You mutter, as your cries ring out.
            <br>
            I guess happy-ever-afters are just fairytales after all.

        </p>
