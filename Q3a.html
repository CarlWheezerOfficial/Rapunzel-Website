        <h3>You chose to hide behind Flynn...</h3>

        <p>
            You run behind Flynn, hoping he can fix this.
            <br>
            Flynn tries reaosning with them.
            <br>
            "YOU ABANDONED US AND LEFT WITH THE ROYAL FAMILY'S GUARDS!" The two yell at him.
            <br>
            The two lunge at him, with a knife.
            <br>
            Your body seems frozen...
            <br>
            "Snap out of it!" You think to yourself...

        </p>

        <p>What will you do?</p>
