        <h3>You chose to look outside!</h3>

        <p> 
            You look outside at the beautiful starry night.
            You gaze at the lanterns floating throughout the air.

            "Today was really fun," You think to yourself.
            "I wonder... If I would have left, could I have seen the lights?"
            
            "Well... I guess I'll never know."

        </p>
        <br>

        <p>The end.</p>
