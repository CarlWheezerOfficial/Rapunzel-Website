        <h3>You chose to ask him about the posters!</h3>

        <p> 
           You ask him about the posters, curiosly. He laughs and wipes sweat off his brow.
           <br>
           "It's just a nobody, you don't need to worry about that." He says, obviously lying.
           <br>
           You shrug your shoulders and agree. 
           <br>
           You take his lie with a grain of salt.
           <br>

           The man says he's heading to see the lights later today...
        </p>
        <br>

        <p>Ask the man to take you too!</p>
