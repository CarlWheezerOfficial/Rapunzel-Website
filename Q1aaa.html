        <h3>You cose to ask him about the posters!</h3>

        <p> 
           You ask him about the posters, curiosly. He laughs and wipes sweat off his brow.
           "It's just a nobody, you don't need to worry about that!" He says, obviusly lying.
           You shrug your shoulders and agree. 
           You take his lie with a grain of salt.

           The man says he's heading to see the lights later today...
